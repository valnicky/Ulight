# Ulight

Welcome to the **Ulight Project**!

Here, we are making a Framework and a website for this Framework!

**Ulight** is a **CSS/ JavaScript Framework** to style original websites.


## The Framework

Ulight allows Front-End Developer to build original websites. **It breaks the rules and the standards of the website to let the developers express their creativity!**

Ulight will propose a large library of set of designed elements that developers should use to style their own HTML files. By using classes, developers will be able to access to that library and should choose the design of their choice.

## The Website

Ulight also needs a website! To present the project and allow web designer to propose new set of designed element to integrate to the Framework.

## How can I contribute?

Ulight is an Open Source project build by a team of Recipient of the Google Developer Challenge Scholarship 2017 - 2018 for Front-End Developer path (Europe, Russia, Egypt, Israel, Turkey).

What does it mean?

It means we are all beginners and hungry to learn! If this definition suits you, welcome!

### Front-End / Integration

We need Integrators to translate the set of designed elements into code to integrate them in the Framework. We will write the code to let the users pick up some classes to add in his/ her HTML file for using original designs in their own website. We also need Front-End developers to build the core of the Framework and the website. Let's build a light and efficient Framework and an interactive website!

### Backend

The Back-End, for those who might not know what it is, is responsible for the functionality of the site including connecting to a database, handling data provided by the user and many more. The language we are going to use is PHP. Most of us are new to this language so don't hesitate to join us even if you are a beginner. The only thing we need from you is to be willing to learn! In the Trello section below you can find a link for our Trello board. You can also find me in Slack @Apostolos Ichtsis.

### UX design

The UX Design team are responsible for building a strong user experience for Ulight. If you are passionate about user experience and design, you will help contribute to the UX document which includes but not limited to challenges, user empathy, defining UX problems, ideation, design concepts, wireframes, prototyping and testing. The UX process which we will follow is: Empathise > Define > Ideate > Prototype > Test.

### UI / Webdesign

We need web designers and graphic designers of all abilities to build the template of the website and the set of designed elements that will be integrated in the Framework. We are focusing mainly on improving skills that we already have, and this will very much be a work in progress that is constantly evolving and improving over time.

### Marketing

We need markters or people that are interested in marketing to make the project in better positioning and present it to the whole community.
