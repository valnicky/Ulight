## I am afraid to contribute...

This project is made for and by **beginners**. Don't be afraid to make any mistake, nobody will judge you here as we are all here to learn :)

The main goal is to **learn altogether** by using a concrete and fun project. It is a quite big one yes, but it is all about the challenge to do this kind of project, to motivate us do **work on community** and on an Open Source project.

If you are afraid to contribute, you can come to speak with us on the #Ulight channel of Slack and share your fears.

You don't have to create a great advanced code to contribute, but even a small one, **you can correct a typo or add comments if you think those are needed.**

We will never close your pull request without **explaning to you** why we do that. But we will preferably discuss with you about your pull request and help you correct your mistakes if you made some :)

As we are all beginners, the **project maintainers are also beginners**. So we can make mistakes as well :)

If you think we have made a mistake, do not hesitate to tell us in order to upgrade the quality of this project!

If you have never made any pull request on your life, **you are in the right place.** You can try to make your first one with us.

## What should I do?

You will find all tasks to do into the [Issues](https://github.com/maevanapcontact/Ulight/issues) page.
Each of them are **labelled**, that means you can filter them depending of your field of interest.
_For instance, you will have the labels: front-end, design…_
**Hint**: you can start by the "good first issue" one, they are perfect for beginners

Then, when you **choose** an issue, click on it and you will have **more info** about it.
There, you can ask question or comment.
If you want to do this task: **Declare yourself** by leaving a comment => this will prevent several people from working on the same task.

Now, it’s up to you!
You can find more info about how issues work at this [link](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
Let’s found out how to do in the next part.

## Pull Request Process

* [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

Here are some tutorials to help you **install and use Git** ([basic commands](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) or [full tutorial](https://www.slideshare.net/IslamSayed18/github-tutorial-83175509))

* **Fork** the project (Here is a [tutorial about Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/))
* **Create a new folder** in your computer to welcome the project from GitHub
* Open the **Git console** and navigate inside your computer, positioned yourself on the new folder you have created
* **Clone your fork** of the repository in your current folder using this command:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-pseudo>/Ulight.git
```

You can find this link following those steps:

1. Go to your **GitHub profile**
2. Go to your **fork** of the Project
3. Press **"Clone or download"**
4. **Copy/ paste the URL** using HTTPs (Not SSH)

* Navigate inside the new folder that had been created using this command:

```
cd Ulight
```

* Set the **remote upstream** to the original repository using this command:

```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/maevanapcontact/Ulight.git
```

* Be sure to be **up-to-date** with your version of the repository with those commands:

```
git checkout master
git pull upstream master
```

For more information about remotes check [this tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote/)

* Create a **new branch** to make your own changes, check those [Udacity Guidelines Git](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/) to know how to create good commits name.

```
git checkout -b name-of-your-branch
```

* **It is the time to open your text editor and to start working on your changes!**

When you are ready to submit your work, then continue.

* Locally **rebase the upstream branch** into the branch you have created to do your changes by using this command:

```
git pull --rebase upstream master
```

* **Push your work** (on your new branch) in your own fork of the project using this command:

```
git push origin name-of-your-branch
```

* Open a **Pull Request** to submit your work. Be sure to propose it into the branch master.

Here is a [tutorial about Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

## Guidelines

For the consistency of this project, the following guides need to be followed.

**If you submit a Pull Request that doesn't follow those guidelines we won't be able to accept it, but we will give you feedback on the conversation!**

* [HTML Guidelines](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/)
* [CSS Guidelines](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/css.html)
* [JavaScript Guidelines](https://udacity.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-styleguide/javascript.html)
* [Git Guidelines](https://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/)

### If you write SCSS...

Please **compile** your scss code before submitting your pull request. You can use [Prepros](https://prepros.io/) which is really easy to use. You can check the [SASS Tutorial from The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0d--jixRwg&index=2&list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iEwigam3gTjU_7IA3W2WZA) to see how Prepros works.

Use the following syntax if you create any new SCSS file "\_name-of-your-file.scss"

And import it on the _style.scss_ file using the code:

```
@import 'name-of-your-file'
```

**DO NOT WRITE CSS DIRECTLY! THE FILE IS GENERATED AUTOMATICALLY**
