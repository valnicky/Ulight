### Tutorial
As we are mainly beginners on this project and that the goal is to learn, we wish to have some tutorials in order to help new comers to understand all the tools we need without taking long hours to make some researches and feel lost. Of course we encourage you to make your own researches, but it is interesting as well to find here everything you need to start working on the project and contributing. <br>
To keep the tutorials consistent, please follow those guidelines:
<ul>
  <li>Please use <a href="https://fr.slideshare.net/">SlideShare</a> to make your tutorial. We think that a visual presentation would be easier to understand some hard concepts (and even the easiest ones).</li>
  <li>Use as much screenshots as you can to help people see what they have to do</li>
  <li>Make a tutorial to use the tools INSIDE this project. There are thousands of great tutorials for each tool on the web, so the goal is not to redo one but to help new comers to use the tools to contribute to this project</li>
  <li>Think about a quick start, no need for hundreds of slides, just the useful content</li>
</ul>
